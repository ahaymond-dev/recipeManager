### Description:
This is a recipe costing app that is aimed to the hospitality industry with the intention to eliminate food waste. it will allow users to create an account, link with a team, create recipes that are costed to the gram with name brand food items. teams can view their shared recipe book or export it to excel. the recipe cards will cost per portion and allow users to change the portion size depending on the desired amount. after the MVP we would also like the app to print nutrition info label to make it easier to donate leftover food to foodbanks.

### Technologies Used:
